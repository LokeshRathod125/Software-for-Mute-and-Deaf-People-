# 🧏‍♂️ Software Tool for Mute and Deaf People
A specialized software solution designed to help mute and deaf individuals communicate effectively through innovative technology.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project enables communication for individuals who are mute or deaf by converting **hand gestures into text and speech** using machine learning and computer vision.  
The system identifies gestures in real time through a webcam and transforms them into understandable output.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition** using webcam input.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion** for communication.
- **On-Screen Text Display** of recognized gestures.
- **Fast Processing** with optimized ML pipelines.
- **Custom ML Model Support** for static and dynamic gestures.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / MediaPipe  
- NumPy  
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)  
- Streamlit or Tkinter (optional UI)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Webcam captures the hand gesture.
2. ML model predicts gesture using key-point detection.
3. Output appears as text on screen.
4. The system uses text-to-speech to speak the output.
